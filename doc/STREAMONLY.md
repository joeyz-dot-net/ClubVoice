StreamOnly branch
=================

Purpose
-------
This branch contains minimal changes and scaffolding for a "stream-only" mode:

- Focus on forwarding audio streams only (no recordings, no extra tools).
- Useful for testing raw streaming performance and integrating compressed codecs.

Notes
-----
- This file is intentionally small; expand with specific changes as needed.
